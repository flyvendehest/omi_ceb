#1, when familirizing ourselves with the Hopper + Grater (Tom & Morten), we used the .PDF (name of it?). Page #2 of the .pdf doesn't have parts numbers on the biggest #4 pieces (they are for the hopper).
#2, (same session as above): We found that the .pdf says that the bars for the grater are "Rebars" (as in "round"), but they are in fact flat.
#3, (same as above): In pdf, page 59: It says it's cut from part #99, but what is meant is part #9.
#4, suggestions for the BOM: that under each part, it says what it is used for (of diff. parts/items).

GRATE
- the 33 flatbar cuts in fab pdf drawings are off. says 25 should be 26.5 inches

HOPPER
- drill press holes are not possible to interpret in the fab drawing pdf

HOW TO CROSSCHECK DOC
- ceck fab pdf drawings, keep in mind from prototype 3
- check if specific page for the part, ie hopper
- check collab production run 4, any links?
### remember to check version history of wiki pages and drawings
- check cad



IDEAS
- plywood instead of metal for grate and hopper?
